# GoAccess-Tool
This repository contains the implementation and documentation of using **GoAccess**, an open-source real-time log analyzer, for analyzing and visualizing web server logs using interactive visual report generator that helps monitor traffic, detect suspicious behavior, and gain insight into how your web server is being accessed.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the installation and configuration of **GoAccess** in a simulated or real environment. The log data is processed, and visual insights are generated for analyzing web traffic patterns, security threats, and usage analytics.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation
üñ•Ô∏è Environment:
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (tested on WSL as well as native Linux)

Web Server: Apache2 (sample logs located at /var/log/apache2/access.log)

Log Format: Combined (common for most servers)

üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:

For Linux-based systems (Ubuntu/Debian):
bash

sudo apt update

sudo apt install goaccess -y

For macOS:
brew install goaccess


üí° Use Cases:
GoAccess proves to be a powerful tool in a variety of real-world scenarios:

- View real-time analytics of HTTP status codes  
  Instantly monitor server responses like 404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden, and 500 Internal Server Error.  
  Helps in identifying broken links, access violations, or internal failures as they occur.

- Detect suspicious IPs  
  Easily spot IP addresses with high request volumes or irregular behavior patterns.  
  Useful for identifying brute-force attacks, vulnerability scanning bots, or DoS attempts.

- Monitor top requested pages and referrers  
  Understand what content is most popular among users.  
  Analyze which external sources (e.g., search engines, social media) are driving traffic to your site.

- Identify peak traffic hours and bandwidth usage  
  Visualize traffic spikes and high-load periods to better manage server resources.  
  Helps plan for scaling, maintenance windows, or optimizing server performance.

- Evaluate effectiveness of firewalls or security rules  
  Cross-reference blocked requests and failed attempts with firewall or IDS configurations.  
  Useful for refining security rules and understanding if they are successfully mitigating threats.
